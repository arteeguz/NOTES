WAIK (Windows Automated Installation Kit):

Purpose: Helps in deploying Windows OS with custom settings.
Features:
Includes tools like Windows System Image Manager (WSIM), ImageX, and more.
Used for creating and customizing Windows images.
Provides command-line tools for deployment.
Scenario: Customizing Windows Installation
When to Use: When you need to create a custom Windows installation with specific settings and applications.
How to Use:
Install WAIK on your computer.
Use Windows System Image Manager (WSIM) to create an answer file (.xml) for an unattended installation.
Use ImageX to capture a base image of Windows.
Apply the answer file to the image to customize the installation.
Deploy the customized image using MDT or other deployment tools.

TS (Task Sequences)
Task Sequences:

Purpose: Automates the steps in the deployment process.
Features:
Customizable steps for OS deployment, application installation, driver installation, etc.
Can include conditions and branching.
Scenario: Automated Deployment of Standard Configuration
When to Use: When you need to ensure all new computers have a standard configuration, including OS, applications, and settings.
How to Use:
Create a task sequence in MDT.
Choose a template (e.g., Standard Client Task Sequence).
Customize the task sequence by adding steps for OS installation, application installation, and configuration settings.
Use the task sequence during deployment to automate the entire process.

Create new task sequence in MDT:
Use MDT GUI
Build
Build:

Purpose: The process of creating a deployable system image.
Features:
Combines OS, applications, updates, and settings into a single image.
Ensures consistency across multiple deployments.
Scenario: Creating a Standardized System Image
When to Use: When you need to create a standardized image that can be deployed to multiple computers.
How to Use:
Prepare a reference computer with the desired OS, applications, and settings.
Use Sysprep to generalize the system (removes unique information).
Capture the image using ImageX or MDT.
Store the image in the deployment share for future use.
Quick Reference Commands:
Sysprep:
cmd
Copy code
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /shutdown
Capture image:
cmd
Copy code
ImageX /capture C: D:\Images\GoldenImage.wim "Golden Image"
Golden / Pristine Image
Golden / Pristine Image:

Purpose: A master image that is clean, fully updated, and configured as a standard for deployment.
Features:
Contains OS, critical updates, and core applications.
Used as a baseline for creating new deployments.
Scenario: Ensuring Consistency Across Deployments
When to Use: When you need a clean, fully updated image as a baseline for all future deployments.
How to Use:
Install a fresh copy of the OS on a reference machine.
Apply all updates and install core applications.
Configure system settings as needed.
Use Sysprep to generalize the image.
Capture the image using ImageX or MDT.
Store the golden image in the deployment share for future use.
Quick Reference Commands:
Sysprep:
cmd
Copy code
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /shutdown
Capture image:
cmd
Copy code
ImageX /capture C: D:\Images\GoldenImage.wim "Golden Image"
WIM (Windows Imaging Format)
WIM (Windows Imaging Format):

Purpose: File-based disk image format used by Microsoft for deployment.
Features:
Can capture multiple images within a single WIM file.
Allows for compression to save space.
Supports image mounting and modification.
Scenario: Managing and Modifying System Images
When to Use: When you need to capture, modify, and deploy system images.
How to Use:
Use ImageX or DISM to capture a WIM image of a system.
To modify the image, use DISM to mount the WIM image.
Command: DISM /Mount-WIM /WimFile:D:\Images\MyImage.wim /Index:1 /MountDir:C:\Mount
Make the necessary modifications to the mounted image.
Unmount the image and commit changes:
Command: DISM /Unmount-WIM /MountDir:C:\Mount /Commit
Deploy the WIM image to target machines as needed.
Quick Reference Commands:
Mount WIM:
cmd
Copy code
DISM /Mount-WIM /WimFile:D:\Images\MyImage.wim /Index:1 /MountDir:C:\Mount
