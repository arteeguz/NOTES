Technologies and Tools Needed
Front-End (Mobile App)
Cross-Platform Development Framework: Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin.
Examples: Flutter SDK, React Native CLI.
IDEs:
For Android: Android Studio.
For iOS: Xcode.
General: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
AR and Positioning Plugins:
AR support.
Examples: ARCore (Android), ARKit (iOS).
BLE beacon support.
Examples: CoreBluetooth (iOS), Android Bluetooth API.
Wi-Fi positioning.
Examples: Wi-Fi APIs available in Android/iOS SDKs.
Back-End
Server-Side Development Platform: Any robust platform that supports RESTful API creation.
Examples: Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, Java with Spring Boot.
Database: A database system to store user data, maps, and navigation information.
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
Real-Time Communication: For real-time updates and communication between server and clients.
Examples: WebSockets, Socket.io.
Web Server: To serve the back-end application.
Examples: Nginx, Apache.
Containerization: To ensure consistent deployment environments.
Examples: Docker.
Additional Tools
API Testing: For testing back-end APIs.
Examples: Postman, Insomnia.
Version Control: For managing code and collaboration.
Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.
Deployment: For deploying the back-end server.
Examples: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, Heroku.
Design Plan
1. Project Setup
Initialize Front-End Project: Set up a new project using the chosen cross-platform framework.
Initialize Back-End Project: Set up a new server-side project with the chosen platform and framework.
2. Database Design
User Table: Store user information (user ID, name, email, etc.).
Desk Table: Store desk information (desk ID, floor number, location coordinates, etc.).
Map Data: Store floor map data and AR markers.
3. API Design
User Authentication:
Sign Up: POST /api/auth/signup
Login: POST /api/auth/login
Desk Information:
Get Desk Info: GET /api/desk/:deskId
Get All Desks on Floor: GET /api/desks/:floorNumber
Navigation:
Get Navigation Path: POST /api/navigation/path (takes current location and destination desk ID)
4. Mobile App Design
UI Design:

Login/Sign Up Screen: Allow users to log in or sign up.
Home Screen: Show the office layout with search functionality.
Search Screen: Allow users to search for specific desks.
Map Screen: Display the floor map and AR navigation.
Settings Screen: Allow users to configure preferences.
Navigation Logic:

Determine User Position: Use Wi-Fi positioning or BLE beacons to determine the user's current location.
Calculate Route: Use the back-end API to get the shortest path to the destination desk.
AR Navigation: Use ARCore or ARKit to provide step-by-step navigation.
State Management:

Use a state management solution provided by the chosen framework (e.g., Provider for Flutter, Redux for React Native).
5. Implementation Steps
Front-End:

Setup Project:
Create a new project using Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin.
Install necessary plugins for AR, BLE, Wi-Fi, and maps.
Create UI Screens and navigation logic.
Integrate AR Navigation using ARCore and ARKit.
Implement Wi-Fi and BLE Positioning.
Back-End:

Setup Project:
Create a new project using Node.js, Python, or Java.
Install necessary frameworks and libraries (e.g., Express for Node.js, Flask for Python).
Create RESTful APIs:
Authentication routes
Desk information routes
Navigation routes
Connect to Database:
Set up schemas and models for user and desk data.
Implement Real-Time Communication using WebSockets.
Deploy the back-end server to a cloud provider.
6. Testing and Deployment
Front-End Testing:

Test on both Android and iOS simulators/emulators.
Use physical devices for AR testing.
Back-End Testing:

Use Postman to test API endpoints.
Write unit tests for API endpoints.
Deployment:

Deploy the back-end server to a cloud provider.
Distribute the mobile app through Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
Summary
Front-End:

Choose a cross-platform framework: Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin.

Integrate AR, BLE, and Wi-Fi positioning plugins/APIs.
Back-End:

Choose a server-side development platform: Node.js, Python, or Java.
Use a database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
Implement real-time communication: WebSockets.
Use a web server: Nginx or Apache.
Consider containerization: Docker.
Additional Tools:

API testing: Postman.
Version control: Git, GitHub.
Deployment: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Heroku.
Design Plan:

Set up projects, design database and APIs, implement UI and navigation logic, test and deploy.
